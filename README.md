# word-ladder-game

A Word Ladder is a word game in which players find paths between words by switching one letter at a time. 
For example, one can link “ape” and “man” in the following way ape->apt->ait->bit->big->bag->mag->man. 
Note that each step involves changing just one letter of the word. 
This is just one possible path from “ape” to “man”, but is it the shortest possible path?
